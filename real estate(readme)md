Price of the property is one of the most important decision when people buy homes.

This project has the data of customers those who already buyed the home with price

For predicting the property based on lot of factors. This Research aims to understand all patterns and to apply analytics for price prediction

The aim is to building regression models which will predict the continuous numeric( price ) for each property
And prediction depending on the multiple positional and general factors

Examining the data imputing missing values   and dealing with outliers

The correlation between the features founded by corr( ) function.

Algorithms used: Linear Regression, Decision Tree  and  Random Forest regression with  hyper parameters, k-fold cross validation

The quality of a Regression Model is, how well predictions match up against actual values, and Error metrics(RMSE) are used to judge the quality of the model.

From the above mentioned models ,Random Forest is the best model as it has the lowest RMSE score,  Which  tells that the how well the model fits in this data
